* 7-8. Deli: Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various
sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop
through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such
as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list
of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a
message listing each sandwich that was made.
* 7-9. No Pastrami: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure
the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code
near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has
run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of
'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up
in finished_sandwiches.
* 7-10. Dream Vacation: Write a program that polls users about their dream
vacation. Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one place in the world,
where would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.

text of a message that should be printed on the shirt. The function should print
a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it.
Call the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt. Call the
function a second time using keyword arguments.

by default with a message that reads I love Python. Make a large shirt and a
medium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size with a different
message.

a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as
Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a default value.
Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the
default country.
