* 7-8. Deli: Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of various
sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop
through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such
as I made your tuna sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list
of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a
message listing each sandwich that was made.
* 7-9. No Pastrami: Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure
the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code
near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has
run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of
'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up
in finished_sandwiches.
* 7-10. Dream Vacation: Write a program that polls users about their dream
vacation. Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one place in the world,
where would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.

* 8-1. Message: Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence
telling everyone what you are learning about in this chapter. Call the
function, and make sure the message displays correctly.
* 8-2. Favorite Book: Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one
parameter, title. The function should print a message, such as One of my
favorite books is Alice in Wonderland. Call the function, making sure to 
include a book title as an argument in the function call.

* 8-3. T-Shirt: Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the
text of a message that should be printed on the shirt. The function should print
a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it.
Call the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt. Call the
function a second time using keyword arguments.
* 8-4. Large Shirts: Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large
by default with a message that reads I love Python. Make a large shirt and a
medium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size with a different
message.
* 8-5. Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of
a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as
Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a default value.
Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the
default country.

* 8-6. City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name
of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:
"Santiago, Chile"
Call your function with at least three city-country pairs, and print the value
that’s returned.
* 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the
album information correctly.
Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
of tracks, add that value to the album’s dictionary. Make at least one new
function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
* 8-8. User Albums: Start with your program from Exercise 8-7. Write a while
loop that allows users to enter an album’s artist and title. Once you have that
information, call make_album() with the user’s input and print the dictionary
that’s created. Be sure to include a quit value in the while loop.

* 8-9. Magicians: Make a list of magician’s names. Pass the list to a function
called show_magicians(), which prints the name of each magician in the list.
* 8-10. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9.
Write a function called make_great() that modifies the list of magicians by adding
the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to
see that the list has actually been modified.
* 8-11. Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 8-10. Call the
function make_great() with a copy of the list of magicians’ names. Because the
original list will be unchanged, return the new list and store it in a separate list.
Call show_magicians() with each list to show that you have one list of the original
names and one list with the Great added to each magician’s name.
